    "# Automated traiding strategy - Data project\n",
    "In this project we will investigates the feasibility of predicting companies' future stock prices and achieving an abnormal excess return. The project will focus on companies in the Dow Jones index from the year 2013 to 2019. We will use an API from financial modelling prep, which allows us to access key financial data for all the companies, with a primary focus on P/S, P/B, P/E, DCF and WACC. To evaluate the model, the project compares its predictions against actual market outcomes. Here we determine a buy or sell recommendation for the year 2014-2019 for the ratios and only recommend for the year 2019 with the DCF and WACC variables. The project will compare predictions against actual outcomes for all the different financial variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "The API is free to use after creating an account but has a limit of 250 requests a day. Therefore, to access all 30 companies in the Dow Jones index, one must wait 24 hours to get the data for the next companies or create a second account. We used two accounts to get the data from the first 25 companies and then the last 5 companies. \n",
    "\n",
    "We saved the data in a CSV file to avoid having to wait 24 hours to get the data. Meaning, final_merger.csv contains all the financial variables and the profit_difference:more_years.csv and contains the profit difference for the years 2014-2019. "

    "# CAPM\n",
    "\n",
    "The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) explains the relationship between an asset's expected return and its systematic risk, represented by the $\\beta$ coefficient. Developed by Sharpe in 1964, the model posits that investors can mitigate unsystematic risk by maintaining a well-diversified portfolio of numerous assets. CAPM assumes that investors are rational and risk-averse, and that a risk-free asset exists, offering a constant interest rate without transaction costs or taxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the CAPM, a higher $\\beta$ results in a higher expected return. This project will examine the CAPM theory by creating a long-short strategy based on two portfolios: purchasing a high-beta portfolio while simultaneously shorting a low-beta portfolio. Consequently, the average excess returns should yield a return greater than the risk-free rate, as indicated by Tidy Finance. This analysis will help determine whether it is possible to achieve abnormal excess returns based on a stock's $\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CAPM can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E[R_i] = R_f + \\beta_i \\dot (E[R_m]-R_f)$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, $E[R_i]$ represents the expected return, Rf denotes the risk-free rate, and $E[R_m] - R_f$ is the market risk premium. When $\\beta > 1$ in equation (1), it signifies that a stock carries more risk compared to the market, and the opposite holds true for $\\beta < 1$. The paper employs the subsequent formula to calculate $\\beta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta = \\frac{Covariance(R_e, R_m)}{Variance(R_m)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this formula, $R_e$ represents the return on a specific stock, while $R_m$ denotes the return on the entire market.\n"

    "### Financial ratios\n",
    "The following section discusses different valuation methods used to determine the intrinsic value of a company. These methods include price to earnings (P/E), price to book (P/B), price to sales (P/S), discounted cash flow (DCF), $\\beta$, and weighted average cost of capital (WACC).\n",
    "\n",
    "The P/E ratio reflects how much investors are willing to pay for each unit of a company's earnings. A high P/E ratio suggests that the company is overvalued, while a low P/E ratio indicates that it is undervalued. This projet will utilize the trailing P/E ratio, which divides the current share price by the total earnings per share in the past 12 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "The P/B ratio evaluates whether a firm is overvalued or undervalued by comparing its market capitalization to its book value. Divide the company's current share price by its book value per share to obtain the P/B ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The P/S ratio is used to compare a company's stock price to its revenue. A low P/S ratio may indicate that the stock is undervalued, while a ratio higher than the average could imply that the stock is overvalued.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DCF method estimates the value of a company by predicting its future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The project will use an unlevered DCF, which forecasts free cash flows before interest expense and interest income. The DCF analysis aims to value the company as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WACC measures the average cost of financing a company's assets using both debt and equity sources. It indicates how much return a company needs to generate to satisfy its creditors and shareholders. This project will use a formula to calculate the WACC and is given by,\n",
    "\n",
    "$WACC = \\left(\\frac{V_E}{V_E + V_D}\\right)R_e + \\left(\\frac{V_D}{V_E + V_D}\\right)R_d(1 - \\tau_c)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R_e$ is the cost of equity, $R_d$ is the cost of debt, $V_E$ is the market value of the firm's equity, $V_D$ is the market value of the firm's debt, and $tau_c$ is corporation tax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project will compare the different valuation methods against other companies in the same industry to determine if a company is overvalued or undervalued."

It starts by including the count of data points for the P/Es, then the arithmetic average of the data points. The STD illustrates how spread out the data is from the mean. Lastly, the min and max are the minimum and maximum values in the dataset. These descriptive statistics are used for the P/E, P/B, P/S, DCF, and WACC. Furthermore, we observe that we are missing a lot of data for the DCF variable and we are missing data for the WACC variable for the firms AMZN and DOW. The missing data is since the API does not provide the data for these firms."

The standard deviation value of 10.34 shows a rather large dispersal from the mean and lastly, the minimum value of -2.88 is the smallest profit difference and 28.34 the largest. "

If the ratio is greater than the mean we predict that the profit difference will be positive and if the ratio is less than the mean we predict that the profit difference will be negative. Lastly, we compare these prediction to the actualt profit difference.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Based on a 5% significance level, it can be concluded that the three OLS regression models for the financial ratios, DCF, and WACC are not statistically significant. This implies that these variables are not reliable predictors of the expected return. However, it should be noted that the DCF predictions were accurate 94% of the time, suggesting that DCF could still be a useful predictor for the expected return.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the predictions for the other variables performed poorly, which is consistent with the OLS regression results. It is important to keep in mind that this project is based on a small dataset, and the results may differ if a larger dataset is used. Therefore, further research is needed to determine whether financial ratios, DCF, and WACC are indeed poor or good predictors for the expected return."
