This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. I fetch data from the **World Bank** on **CO2 emissions and population** and show that some parts of the world increase their CO2 emissions per capita while others decrease their emissions.
3. Model project. I simulate an AS-AD model for an open economy with a floating exchange rate. The centralbank perform "dirty floating". I examine how the model changes based on the parameter values.
