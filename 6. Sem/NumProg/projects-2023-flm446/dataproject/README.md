# Data analysis project

My project is titled ** Evolution of CO2 emissions ** and is about how CO2 emissions per capita have evolved in different regions of the world relative to their levels in 1990. I use data from the World Bank on CO2 emissions and population.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

`#%pip install pandas-datareader
