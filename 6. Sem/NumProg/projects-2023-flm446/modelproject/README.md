# Model analysis project

My project is titled **Simulation of an AS-AD model** and is about short run fluctuations in an open econonmy with a floating exchange rate. I examine this economy by simulating the model over a number of periods, for different parameter values.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
