This repository contains three projects. The three projects are made in relation to the course: Introduction to programming. Below in our repository the projects are listed and breifly described.

**1. Inaugural project**
    The inagural project is out first project and our first experience with programming in python. In this project we solve a model and examine the results by plotting figures and tables.

**2. Data project**
    The data project is about the ability to fetch data from an external source, analyse the data in python and draw a conclusion. In our data project, we fetch data from DST on unemployment in Denmark. Moreover, we examine how the state of the economy has an effect on the unemployment regarding gender.

**3. Model project**
    In the model project we create a model. We have chosen to create a Solow-model with humancapital. The project contains a analytical solution, which give us the theoretical nullclines as well as the equation for steady state. The numerical solution has a simulation based on a hypothetical scenario to find the optimal moments for the model.

More information is given in the README-file for each project.
