# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Solow Model with Human Capital** and is about solving the model with respect to the null clines. Aftwerwards, simulating a hypothetical scenario and coming up with a numerical solution that optimizes the model.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb) and the py-file.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
