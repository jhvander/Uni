# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Volatility Surface** and is about options implied volatility, and how we can illustrate this by plotting a 3D-surface of the relations.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [VolatilitySurface.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:

Yahoo Finance API - yfinance, imported as yf in the code

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install yfinance``
``pip install datetime``
