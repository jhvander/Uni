This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from DST API tabel **INDKP132** on **KM6** and examine the correlation between average disposable family income and membership of the Danish Church
3. Model project. We model a Koopman economy. First, we find the analytical solution in our baseline model, where the utility function is a Cobb-Douglas function. Secondly, we find the solution numerical by an algorithm described in the notebook. The extension of our model is to use a CES utility function in order to allow different degrees of substitutability, as the Cobb-Douglas function has strong assumption about income and substitution effect.
4. Exam project. We answer the questions given for the exam.
