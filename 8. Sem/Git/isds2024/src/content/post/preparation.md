# Guide to preparations

It is necessary that you plan enough time to prepare for the course. We expect that, depending on your prior experience, you have spent up to 50 hours on learning basic Python and pandas before we begin teaching. In particular you should do the following (prioritized order):

1. [Install anaconda and other software](/isds2024/post/install/)
2. Open the Assignment 0 notebook. [See this guide](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-use-jupyter-notebooks) on how to open and use a notebook
3. Work on Assignment 0 - try to solve as much as possible
4. When you get stuck, you should follow the trouble shooting guideline below - start with a) and move to d):

    a) See material below for learning Python - make sure you have read all material about the relevant problem.

    b) Search on Google, in particular stackexchange is very useful.

    c) Ask other people, you may already know other Python experts.

    d) Open a GitHub issue in our [ISDS2024 repository](https://github.com/isdsucph/isds2024) as the *very last* step.

## Assignment 0

In preparation for the course you are expected to hand in an assignment in Python before lectures begin. This assignment is intended to ensure that you all know enough basic Python when you begin the summer school.
The assignment is available now on Absalon, and must be **handed in via Absalon**. See the deadline in the [assignment post](/isds2024/post/assignment/).

The assignment is **individual**. You are welcome to discuss answers with others. The answers you provide in the assignment will be used to **place you into groups**, see [practical info](/isds2024/page/practical/) for details. Your
group members will be randomly selected among those who performed approximately equally well on Assignment 0.

## Material for learning Python

The assignment comes with built-in teaching material and references for learning more if you need more clarification.

Remember to ask questions through GitHub issues in our [ISDS2024 repository](https://github.com/isdsucph/isds2024/issues)!
